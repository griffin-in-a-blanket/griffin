# Welcome to [Griffin's Website](https://griffin-cat.netlify.app/)

## About

We love our pets and want everybody to know how special their little guy is. We teamed up to make a website about our cat. Griffin is the floofiest, bestest cat there is and so much so that we made a website dedicated to Griffin. This website will teach you everything there is to know about this kitty cat from the anatomy to his personality to even a pop quiz because we all love pop quizzes.
